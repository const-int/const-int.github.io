<p>To get started, you’ll first need to install VirtualBox. Once installed, head over to Vagrant Downloads and grab the latest version.</p>

<p>I won’t go into the depths of setting up a project from scratch as there is a great getting started guide on the Vagrant website. I’d recommend taking a look through the documentation to familiarise yourself with Vagrant and its commands. Rather than learning about dev-ops and creating your own provisioning scripts to provision a Vagrant box, there are many tools out there to get you up and running in minutes. One of my favourites is Vaprobash.</p>
