<p>It’s simple. My site has two folders: source and build. All my templates/Sass files are in the source folder, which are then compiled into flat HTML and CSS files in the build folder when I’m ready to deploy. I then deploy the build folder to my server and that’s it. No database synching to worry about.</p>
