<p>On a recent project I needed to handle multiple large forms and monitor how the data handled each step of the way. Going through the forms manually is not only tedious, but very time consuming. To overcome this I decided to write a small, lightweight JavaScript plugin which will auto-fill form inputs based on given data.</p>
