Vagrant solves all these issues by allowing us to create portable virtual development environments. This means you can have as many environments as you need, each configured differently to suite the project requirements. So if you need PHP 5.4 on one project and PHP 5.3 on another, Vagrant makes it easy to manage. Replicating an environment on a different machine is as simple as running $ vagrant up, saving you the hard work and time of installing and configuring everything manually. Awesome!
