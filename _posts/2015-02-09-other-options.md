Another route I tried is to use the built-in Apache on OSX, along with installing MySQL and multiple PHP versions. Whilst this freed me from MAMP, it was a fairly complicated process and came across a few issues along the way. Replicating the same process on different machines isn’t an easy task, not to mention time consuming—especially in a team where everyone would need to have the same setup. If you had two projects with two different software requirements, things start to get complicated, too. So how do we solve these issues?
